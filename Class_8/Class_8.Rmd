### 1. R studio

RStudio is a shell and programming environment for the R language. It makes working with R much easier and more intuitive by providing a user interface to R features originally hidden behind R functions. However, remember that all actions can be also performed within the classical R console. 

**Instalation**

Follow the [link](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), choose the appropriate operating system and install R studio. Have in mind that R needs to be installed first.

**Appearance**

R Studio has three great advantages over classical R console:  

* saving and editing your code as a text file (.R)  
* running any piece of previously written code (reanalysis)
* displaying all R objects and variables saved in your computer memory at any given moment 

The R Studio window consists of four main panels:

<!-- ![https://sfg-ucsb.github.io/fishery-manageR/images/rstudio_ide.png](C:\Users\Tomasz\Dropbox\Kurs_R\rstudio_ide.png) -->

1. **Code editor** - write your code and save it in a text file (.R). You can run it anytime by highlighting given piece of code and clicking *Run* in right-top corner (also *Ctrl+R*). 
2. **Console** - Exactly the same console as in standard R (see Class 1). Note that any line of code run from *Code editor* will appear in the console. To recall the lastly run line of code use *Arrow-up* (it works as a general way of browsing through the history of the executed commands).
3. **Environment / History**
    + Environment - check all variables and functions present in your computer's memory (RAM). Have in mind they will be lost as soon as you close RStudio.
    + History - access to the entire code run in a given RStudio session.
4. **Files / Plots / Help / Packages**
    + Files - manage files on your computer.
    + Plots - preview generated plots before saving them.
    + Help - access help page (often with examples) for a given function.
    + Packages - manage all additionally installed modules. 

`r colorize("**Ex 1. Create new script file (File >> New File >> R Script) and save it. Write code for all subsequent exercises using Code editor. Remember that to obtain any outcome/result you need to execute/run your code first.**","green")`

**An advice**  
If you want to include some comments within a script file or "turn off" chunk of code, type the hash before it (*#*). Anything written until the end of a given line will be ignored by R. To comment several lines highlight them and use *Ctrl+Shift+c*. Repeat it to uncomment.

### 2. Working directory

Working directory is a folder on your computer where R is operating at the moment. Think about it as a separate room for a given analysis. R will look for and save all files in the working directory by default. You can check current working directory by typing *getwd()*. 

To set new working directory use *Session >> Set Working Directory >> Choose Directory* or use *setwd()* function with a destination path provided as an argument.

Unless you continue a previous analysis, ALWAYS set new working directory.

`r colorize("**Ex 2. Create a new folder and set it as a working directory.**","green")`

**Curiosity**  
Although it is usually easier to create folders traditionally, using your operating system, have in mind that you can also do it through R by using *dir.create()* function.

### 3. "So it begins" - Théoden, 3019 TE

Before performing any new analysis make sure three things are done: 

1. An appropriate working directory is set.  
2. New "R script" text file is created (*"File >> New File >> Rscript"*).
3. Global environment is empty. You can clear it by clicking *broom icon* in the Environment panel or by typing *rm(list = ls())* 

### 4. Data frame

![](/home/tomek/Dropbox/Kurs_R/objects.png)

Data frame is something you probably know as a "table". However it has some unique characteristics:

1. It always has a header. It means that each collumn must have its unique name. If names are not provided R creates them automatically as *V* (as "variable") followed by the consecutive number.
2. Table is always complete. It means that each collumn has the same number of rows. If some data are missing R puts *NA* ("not available") in a given cell.
3. An individual collumn of a data frame, similarly to vectors, can contain only one type of data, but different columns can be of different types.

**Curiosity**  
In R, there is also an object called *matrix* that will not be covered during this course. It looks and behaves similar to the data frame but all cells must contains the same type of data (often numbers). It is usually used in mathematics (matrix operations) and graphics (image encoding).

### 5. Data import and display

Usually, data imported into R are in the form of text files. Commonly used extensions:

* .csv - comma-separated values - rows defined as lines of text, columns separated by commas
* .tsv - tab-separated values - rows defined as lines of text, columns separated by tabs

**For Polish speakers**  
Using Polish versions of some software (e.g. Excel) with default settings of the operating system may generate problems with *.csv* files as comma is used as decimal delimiter. Excel (in polish) by default creates *.csv* file with columns separated by semicolon (;). Then, arguments of importing R functions need to be properly adjusted.  

`r colorize("**Ex 3. Copy and execute the command below to download the file 'CO2.csv' we are going to work on, to your working directory:**","green")`
```{r eval = FALSE}
download.file(url = "https://dl.dropbox.com/s/41kxqpagkvimsle/CO2.csv?dl=1",
              destfile = paste(getwd(),"/CO2.csv",sep = ""))
```

R provides many training datasets that are built-in into R and can be called directly by their names. List of them can be obtained by *data()* function. Also, dataset description can be accessed by typing *?* followed by its name. "CO2" dataset is one of them, however, we downloaded it manually to learn how to import external datasets. 

`r colorize("**Ex 4. Open dataset description for *CO2* dataset. Check the description of research and the meaning of collumns' headers. **","green")` 

`r colorize("**Ex 5. Import the 'CO2.csv' file into R with *read.table()* function and save it to a variable called *my_data*. Check function's manual for the information about arguments' values. Call *my_data*.**","green")`  
First 10 output lines are shown below:  
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
head(tabela,n = 9)
```

**An advice**  
While importing any new file, it is a good practice to display it before in any simple, external text editor (e.g. Notepad) to see its formatting. It helps to properly adjust *read.table()* arguments.

Displaying tables in a console is often uninformative. Especially when the number of columns or rows exceeds console capabilities.

`r colorize("**Ex 6. Call built-in dataset called *infert*. Can you see whole table? If not, what is lacking? Write your answer as a comment within the script file.**","green")`

R Studio provides an easy tool for intuitive visualization of data frames. It is a *View()* function (note that it starts with a capital letter). You can call it also by simply clicking on a data frame within *Environment* panel.

`r colorize("**Ex 7. Dislay *my_data* with *View()* function. Click on header in the opened window to sort the data according to the values in a given column. In what region CO2 uptake is the highest?  Write your answer as a comment within the script file.**","green")`

**Curiosity**  
To print the summary of a data frame within a console, use *summary()* function. It will provide simple statistics for each column separately. Additionally you can display few rows with the *head()* (first rows) or *tail()* (last rows) to see a data frame arrangement.

### 6. Types of data

All values inside one column must be of the same data type, but the columns can be of different types. Type of data within a collumn is defined by its *class*. The most popular classes are:

* *character* - strings (remember that numbers surrounded by quotation marks are also treated as strings) 
* *factor* - strings with the levels carrying information about the number of occurances and order of strings. Factors are commonly used when doing statistics in R, where they serve as indicators of the [nominal scale](https://www.statsdirect.com/help/basics/measurement_scales.htm). Set as default for columns with strings. To change this behavior set the *stringAsFactors* argument of importing function to *FALSE*.  
* *numeric* - real numbers
* *integer* - only integers
* *logical* - logical values (TRUE or FALSE)

**Curiosity**  
You can convert different data types with the use of *as...* functions family e.g. *as.character(),as.factor() ect.*. Note, however, that not all conversions are permitted e.g. a letter cannot be converted into an integer. To change class of a column you need to replace whole column with the result of *as...* function.  

Class of a column can be checked by displaying data frame with *View()* function and putting mouse cursor over the column header. 

`r colorize("**Ex 8. Check the class of column *uptake*. Write your answer as a comment within the script file.**","green")`

Class of column can be also checked with *class()* function. However, as it requires a given collumn as an argument we need to learn subsetting first. 

### 7. Subsetting

Data frame can be subsetted with the use of coordinates (indexes) enclosed within the square brackets. In case of data frames there are always 2 coordinates: *[row_number,column_number]*.  
Note that vectors have only one coordinate, the position, so they can be called one-dimensional objects. Data frames have two dimensions: rows and columns. 

`r colorize("**Ex 9. Return the value from 49^th^ row and 4^th^ column of *my_data*. **","green")`

Expected result:  
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
tabela[49,4]
```

You can call for multiple values in the same time. To define range of coordinates, use colon separating range borders - *e.g. [row_number_1:row_number_2, column_number]*.

`r colorize("**Ex 10. Return first 5 rows for the last 3 collumns of *my_data*.**","green")`

Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
tabela[1:5,3:5]
```

If you want to call for all rows or columns it is enough to leave blank space instead of the respective coordinate - *e.g. [,column_number]*

`r colorize("**Ex 11. Now, save 5^th^ column of *my_data* as a variable called *my_column_5*. Call call the variable, so its content is displayed in console.**","green")`

Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
tabela[,5]
```

Note that the outcome is no longer a table. As we asked for just one column, a series of numbers (vector) was returned. Let's recall vector subsetting.

`r colorize("**Ex 12. Return 3^rd^, 4^th^ and 5^th^ value from variable *my_column_5*.**","green")`

Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
tabela[3:5,5]
```

**Curiosity**  
Pulling one row from the data frame will not result in a vector. It is because a row can contain elements of different types what is not allowed for vectors.

Table can be also subsetted with the use of columns' (or rows') names.

`r colorize("**Ex 13. Return the same column but use column name instead of its number. Don't forget about quotation marks.**","green")`

One another way to obtain whole collumn is to use dollar sign between table's and collumn's name. Such expression is automatically treated as a vector, so it can be directly subsetted to get a particular row. - *e.g. table$collumn_name[row_number]*.

`r colorize("**Ex 14. Return values from 15^th^ to 30^th^ row of *conc* column from *my_data*. Use dollar sign.**","green")`

Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
tabela$conc[15:30]
```

If desired rows (or columns) do not follow each other and the range option cannot be used, vector of coordinates should be provided.

`r colorize("**Ex 15. Create a vector with values 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12 and save it to a variable. Call it.**","green")`

Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
c(3,5,7,9,12)
```

`r colorize("**Ex 16. Return rows of *uptake* column corresponding to values inside the vector created before.**","green")`

Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
tabela$uptake[c(3,5,7,9,12)]
```

You can also subset everything except specified columns (or rows). To do this, put minus (-) before an index or vector of indexes.

`r colorize("**Ex 17. Return all columns except 5^th^.**","green")`

First 10 output lines are shown below: 
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
head(tabela[,-5],10)
```

### 8. Simple manipulations

1. Replacement - assign a given value to specific place in your table with the use of an arrow. It works just as with variables assignment - *e.g. table[row_number,collumn_number] <- new_value*

`r colorize("**Ex 18. Replace 5^th^ value in the column *Type* with the label 'Unknown'. Check whether it was indeed replaced.**","green")`

2. Mathematical operations

You can use classical mathematical operators: +, -, * and /. Remember, however, that mathematical operations make sense only for *integer* or *numeric* data type.

`r colorize("**Ex 19. Recalculate and modify *conc* column to include values in L/L units. Display modified column.**","green")`

Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
tabela$conc <- tabela$conc/1000
tabela$conc
```

Also, you can use simple summary functions from previous class (see Class 1).

`r colorize("**Ex 20. Calculate the mean value of the *uptake* collumn.**","green")`

Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
mean(tabela[,5])
```

3. Simple summaries:
+ *nrow()* - number of rows
+ *ncol()* - number of columns

`r colorize("**Ex 21. Return total number of cells within *my_data*.**","green")`

Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
nrow(tabela)*ncol(tabela)
```

4. Deleting rows with missing data. 

Missing data, as stated before (see point 4), are represented as *NA* (not-available) in R. Most of the functions will raise an error every time the *NA* is provided as the argument.  

`r colorize("**Ex 22. Choose one cell and replace its value with *NA*. Do not add quotation marks as *NA* is an iternal R symbol (just as $\\pi$). Print whole row.**","green")`

Rows with missing data can be removed with *na.omit()* function. To save changes, the result of *na.omit()* function must be saved as a variable. **Note that, in practice, deleting missing data must be well justified. Make sure they do not provide any important information**.

`r colorize("**Ex 23. Remove the row with mising data. Replace variable *my_data* with modified table. Remember that it cannot be undone.**","green")`

### 9. Adding new column or row

1. Adding new column is relatively simple. All you need to have is a vector. However, remember three things:

* length of vector must equal the number of rows of a data frame
* order of values within a vector corresponds to the row numbers
* name of vector will become name of the added column

We are going to add a column with IDs of observations. Note that column with IDs is often necessary in statistical analysis. It is also inherent to the data in [long format](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/wide-and-long-data/) which is strongly advised.

`r colorize("**Ex 24. Create a vector with ID numbers starting from 100. Use one of functions introduced above to obtain the desired length of the vector. Call the vector *ID*.**","green")`

Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
c(100:(98+nrow(tabela)))
```

You can combine data frames with the use of *cbind()* function in the following manner: *cbind(data_frame1,data_frame2)*. Note that a vector can be seen as a data frame with only one column. 

`r colorize("**Ex 25. Place created IDs at the beginning of *my_data* (as first column). Overwrite *my_data* variable.**","green")`

2. Adding new row is more complicated as you cannot create a vector with different types of data. Firstly you need to create a new data frame (similar to the old one) consisting of only new row (or rows). To do this use *data.frame()* function in the following manner: *data.frame(columnName1 = value1, columnName2 = value2,...)*.

`r colorize("**Ex 26. Create data frame with one row and following values: 1,'Kr1','Krakow',unknown',1000,20. Collumns' names should correspond to this of *my_data*. Call it *Added_rows*.**","green")`

Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
data.frame("ID" = 1,"Plant" = "Kr1","Type" = "Krakow","Treatment" = "unknown","conc" = 1000,"uptake" = 20)
```

**Curiosity**  
To combine a data frame with more rows at the same time replace the values for each collumn with the vectors.

To stick data frames by rows use *rbind()* function in the following manner: *rbind(data_frame1,data_frame2)*

`r colorize("**Ex 27. Place created row at the end of *my_data*. Overwrite *my_data* variable.**","green")`

### 10. Saving data frame

To save your data frame into a file use *write.table()* function.

`r colorize("**Ex 28. Save modified *my_data* to the *.csv* file. Include your surname in the file name**","green")`

### 11. Next classes

**Please, send me the script from today classes and a .csv file with the modified data frame.**

During the next class you will learn about logical expressions, conditions and loops.

### 12. Homework

**Prepare your homework in the form of a script file (.R) and include your surname in its name.**

All exercises need to be performed on built-in *swiss* dataset. Include all subsequent steps in a script file.  
1. Calculate the highest percentage of non-catholics.  
2. Calculate mean infant mortality.  
3. Add column with ID for each observation.  
4. Remove 3 first rows  
5. Save a dataset to a .csv file
