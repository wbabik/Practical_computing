# Class 7
# Basics of R and Rstudio

## What is R?

R is a powerful programming language, broadly used for:

* data processing
* statistical analysis
* production of highly-customizable, publication quality graphs
* computer simulations 
* ... and much more

R is a particularly popular  tool in biology, so knowing the basics of R is an important asset of any bilogist

## Installation

To install R for Windows follow the [link](https://cran.uni-muenster.de/bin/windows/base/) and then click on "Download R -- *version_number* -- for Windows". As of the time of writing the currect R version was 4.0.5.  
To install R for OS X (Macs) follow the [link](https://cran.uni-muenster.de/) and then click on "Download R for (Mac) OS X"  
To install R for Linux type the following lines in the terminal:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base
```

Run R. You should see a window similar to the one below. Your language version may differ, below is the Polish one. Language version don't affect the commands of the R language itself

![R](R_GUI_PL.png)

It is so called R console. Anything written and executed within a console will be interpreted (calculated) by R and usually R will print out something in the console. 

## R as a calculator

R understands standard mathematical operators: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division) and `^` (raising to a power).

### Exercise 1
Sum up all integers from 1 to 10 using the `+` operator.

Expected result:  
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
sum(c(1:10))
```

### Exercise 2
Raise the result of exercise 1 to the power of 5.  

Expected result:  
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
sum(c(1:10))^5
```

> R also provides two additional operators:   
> `%%` - **modulus** - returns the remainder from the division of one number by another, e. g.,  `10 %% 3 = 1`
>
> `%/%` - **integer division** - returns how many times one number is contained in the other, e. g., `10 %/% 3 = 3`

### Exercise 3
For numbers 10, 156, 557, 777 and 1055, check which one are divisible by 7 (i.e., divisible without remainder)

Due to its enormous importance in science $\pi$ value can be obtained just by typing `pi`.


### Exercise 4
Calculate the area of circle which radius equals 40 meters.  
Expected result:  
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
pi*40^2
```

> #### Order of operations 
> R uses the standard order of mathematical operations. However, it is usually a good practice to use parentheses to be explicit.

> #### Built-in functions
> R provides a number of commonly used mathematical functions, such as:   
> `log()` natural logarithm  
> `log10()` logarithm with base 10  
> `exp()` raises the Euler number (e, the base of the natural logarithm) to a given power  
> `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()` trigonometric functions   
> `abs()` absolute value  
> The argument of the function is provided in parentheses, e.g., exponent of e for `exp() or the angle in radians for trigonometric functions.

### Exercise 5
Calculate the natural logarithm and logarithm with base 10 of 1000.  
Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
log(1000)
log10(1000)
```

### 4. Variables

Until you name something it does not exist in a computer memory! Any outcome of the execution of a command within the console perishes when the calculation is finished, unless it is assigned to a given name. Named objects within the computer memory are called "variables". You can create one by using arrows (assignement symbol) in the following manner:   
*chosen_name <- object_to_be_saved*  
You can easily recall the value of the variable later on by typing its name.

`r colorize("**Ex 6. Try to save *5* as variable. Choose a variable name on your own. Then, type your variable's name and press *Enter*.**","green")`  
Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
5
```
**An advice**   
The variable name is case sensitive and cannot contain blank spaces or start with a digit. When you want to combine several words into one name use the underscore (_). By convention dots are used for function names and should be used with caution.

Since the variable is saved, its name can replace the actual value in any R commands e.g. if *2* is assigned to *x*, both *2+3* and *x+3* would result in *5*. 

`r colorize("**Ex 7. Using the table from exercise 5, calculate the range of species frequencies for both populations and save them as separate variables. Then using chosen names, calculate the absolute difference between ranges. Save it to a variable called *range_diff* and call it.**","green")`    
Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
abs((0.8-0.1)-(0.6-0.2))
```

Variables can also be overwritten. It is done by assigning a new object to the already used variable's name. Remember, however, that once you overwrite the variable the old value disappears for good.

`r colorize("**Ex 8. Change variable *range_diff* by increasing its value by 20%. Call it.**","green")`    
Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
p <- abs((0.8-0.1)-(0.6-0.2))
p+0.2*p
```

Variables can store not only numbers. The other very popular type of data is *string*. It is a text which behaves as a single object regardless of its length. To distinguish strings from variable names R requires usage of quotation marks around them.

`r colorize("**Ex 9. Save your name to the variable *my_name*. Call it.**","green")` 

### 5. Functions

One of the usual ways to deal with your data in R is to use functions. They are simply lines of code saved in a computer memory that perform desired operations and often return a result.  
Functions we used before take only a single argument e.g. log() takes a number. However, it is rarely the case. List of function's arguments and the way of usage can be found in function's manual. It can be reached by typing *?* followed by the function's name.**  

`r colorize("**Ex 10. Open the manual for *paste()* function.**","green")`

<!--![](/home/tomek/Dropbox/Kurs_R/paste_manual.png)  -->

Usually the manual consists of 7 sections:  
- DESCRIPTION - the aim of the function  
- USAGE - the syntax  
- ARGUMENTS - arguments passed to the function and their meaning  
- DETAILS - detailed description of the function behaviour  
- VALUE - outcome of the function  
- REFERENCES - often the scientific article function is based on
- EXAMPLES

`r colorize("**Ex 11. Use** *paste()* **function to stick the following words together:** 'I'm', 'using' **and** 'R'.\n**Don't forget about quotation marks.**","green")` 

Expected result:
``` {r,comment = "",echo = FALSE}
paste("I'm","using","R")
```

Arguments passed to functions often have their own names.  
Distinctive names are crucial because many functions take multiple arguments that need to be distinguished.
Such named arguments are passed in the following pattern: *argument_name = argument_value*.  

`r colorize("**Ex 12. Use the same function as above but set another argument called** *sep* **(separator) to** '_'","green")`  

Expected result:
``` {r,comment = "",echo = FALSE}
paste("I'm","using","R",sep = "_")
```
Note that blank space was replaced with underscore. However, where did the blank spaces come from at the first space? The answer is that some arguments have their default values that would be taken if no value is put into function.  
In the above case the default value for *sep* argument is a blank space (" "). 

**An advice**  
It is a good practice to use argument names while calling a function. Although, R can "guess" the argument name by the order in which arguments are typed, it can work improperly when the number of arguments is not strictly defined ("..." sign in function description).

### 6. Vectors

Vector is a series of numbers (or strings) that are saved as a single variable. A new vector can be created with *c()* function in the following manner: *c(value_1,value_2,value_3,...)*. 

`r colorize("**Ex 13. Create a vector containing integers from 5 to 10 and save it to a variable. Call it.**","green")`  
Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
c(5:10)
```

**To create a vector of consecutive integers you can type the limits of the range separated by colon.**

`r colorize("**Ex 14. Create a vector containing integers from 1 to 100 and save it to a variable *one_to_hundred*. Call it.**","green")`  
Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
vec1 <- c(1:100)
vec1
```

**An advice**   
Note that concerning ranges, R is fully inclusive which means that both limits of the range will be included in the final outcome.

To create a vector of consecutive numbers which differ by a given value, use *seq()* function. Note that the function will return a vector so there is no need to use *c()*. 

`r colorize("**Ex 15. Access *seq()* manual. Using *seq()* function, create a vector of numbers between 0 and 1 that differ by 0.1.**","green")`  
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1)
```

To create a vector of repeated values, use *rep()* function:  

`r colorize("**Ex 16. Access *rep()* manual by typing *?rep* in console. Using *rep()* function, create a vector consisting of 1,2 and 3 repeated 20 times. Save it as a variable *repeated*.**","green")`  
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
vec <- rep(c(1,2,3),times = 20)
vec
```

All elements of a vector have to be of the same type. While trying to combine different types, R will try to reformat some of them.

`r colorize("**Ex 17. Create a vector from 1 to 4 with odd numbers typed as digits and even numbers typed as words. What is the outcome? Vector of integers or vector of strings? **","green")` 

### 6. Vector machinations

Useful functions:  
**min()** - minimum value  
**max()** - maximum value  
**sum()** - sum up all numbers in a vector  
**prod()** - multiply all numbers in a vector  
**mean()** - average value  
**median()** - central value  
**length()** - number of elements in a vector  
**sort()** - sort values (default is ascending order, use *decreasing* argument to sort in descending order)  
**unique()** - return unique values  
**round()** - round numbers (to integers by default)

`r colorize("**Ex 18. Having a vector *one_to_hundred* calculate its mean and median**","green")`  
Expected results:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
mean(vec1)
median(vec1)
```

`r colorize("**Ex 19. Having a vector *repeated* sort it and return unique values.**","green")`  
Expected results:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
sort(rep(c(1,2,3),times = 20))
unique(rep(c(1,2,3),times = 20))
```
Vectors can be also used in typical mathematical operations. However there is one important rule: shorter vector will be repeated until it reaches length of longer one (single number is treated as vector of length 1).

Examples:  
```{r echo = TRUE, comment= ""}
c(1,2,3,4) + 5     # 5 is added to each element, the same as c(1,2,3,4) + c(5,5,5,5)
```
```{r echo = TRUE, comment= ""}
c(1,2,3,4) + c(1,2)     # the same as c(1,2,3,4) + c(1,2,1,2)
```

`r colorize("**Ex 20. Having a vector *one_to_hundred*, raise each element to the power of 3. Save it to a variable called *power_3*.**","green")`  
Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
c(1:100)^3
```

### 7. Accessing elements of a vector

**Vector can be subsetted in the following manner: *vector_name[element_index]***

`r colorize("**Ex 21. Return 15^th^ element of the vector *power_3*.**","green")`  
Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
c(c(1:100)^3)[15]
```

**Colon can be used for ranges just as for vector creation.**

`r colorize("**Ex 22. Return 2^nd^ to 20^th^ element of the vector *power_3*.**","green")`  
Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
c(c(1:100)^3)[2:20]
```

**To obtain multiple values, put a vector instead single position index.**

`r colorize("**Ex 23. Return 15^th^, 30^th^ and 45^th^ element of the vector *power_3*.**","green")`  
Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
c(c(1:100)^3)[c(15,30,45)]
```

`r colorize("**Ex 24. Create a vector consisting of indexes () used in exercises 22 and 23. Save it to a variable. Return elements of the vector *power_3* with the use of previously created vector.**","green")`  
Expected result:
```{r echo = FALSE, comment= ""}
c(c(1:100)^3)[c(2:20,15,30,45)]
```

**An advice**  
While creating a vector you can combine both ranges and single indexes with *c()* function.

### 9. Before leaving - IMPORTANT!!!

**If you want me to check your code written during the class, type the commands below to save the R history. Change file's name to include your surname and send it to me via email.**

```{r echo = TRUE,eval=F, comment= ""}
savehistory(file = "my_history.txt")     # saves your R history to the file "my_history.txt"
getwd()                                  # displays where the file was saved
```
